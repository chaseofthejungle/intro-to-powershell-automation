# Intro to PowerShell Automation Overview Guide

**TODO:** An introductory guide to PowerShell's potential for systems automation.

**Description/Overview:** Microsoft PowerShell is a multi-platform (although it is intended for Windows integration) process automation and configuration management solution. It can be conceptualized as containing three components: an interactive command-line shell program, a configuration management framework, and a scripting language. For networking and systems professionals, PowerShell scripts provide automation for routine and mission-critical processes (including for remote and hybrid production environments, as an alternative to strictly on-premises device management), mitigating the odds of human error and freeing up time to work on other assignments. For activities such as implementing and reinforcing security measures, performing system maintenance, onboarding and offboarding users, adding or swapping devices (even in highly scalable environments), and routine task scheduling, the potential of PowerShell scripts is well evident.

## 1. Common Practice

It is common industry practice for PowerShell scripts to handle:

* File, Process, Service, and User Management. 
* Task Scheduling (PowerShell's built-in Task Scheduler can also be utilized and referenced). 
* Active Directory (AD) Management.
* Executions of Other Scripts (e.g., batch script integration).
* Other Common Network Activities.
